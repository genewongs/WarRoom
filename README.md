### Board

The user may select an arbitrary n x n board size. During development, the application was most commonly tested with a 6x6 board size. If it is the user's turn, they may place any monster that is currently in the off-board section of their monster list onto the board may dragging that monster's icon or card from the monster list directly on to the board. When the monster is dropped onto the board, ownership of that particular monster will be signified by a change in the border color of that monster's icon, which will change from gold to whatever specific color has been assigned to the user (visible next to the heading "On Board" on the top left).

Assuming that it is the user's turn, they may moving any on-board user to any tile on the board. The user may also choose to attack monsters owned by another player my clicking on their own monster. The border color of the selected monster will then change, and the user should click on the enemy monster that they wish to attack next. An attack card should pop up next to where the user has clicked showing the attacks available, along with various stats. The user can then choose a specific attack by clicking on the name of an attack, and confirm their selection by clicking on the "Attack" button, which should change to a red color to signify to the user that the application is ready for their final attack decision.

Once the attack has been completed, there should be one or several messages appearing in the battle event log section of the application, showing whether the attack was successful. Additionally, the enemy monster will fade from view if it has been vanquished by the user's own monster.

#### Ranged Attacks

Monsters are allowed to have ranged attacks in addition to melee attacks.

#### Ending a Turn

Upon initial login the user will be unable to take any action relating to the board until they click on the red "Connect to Game" icon above the board to the right of the "Auto Battle" button. Once "Connect to Game" has been clicked, the button changes into either an "End Turn" button or a "Waiting" button depending on whose turn it is. The current turn holder is indicated by a string of colored text to the bottom of the screen, reading "It's NAME's turn"--the color of said text corresponding to the color assigned to each specific user.

If it is not the user's turn, a warning alert will be displayed above the turn indicator, telling them that it is not their turn.

#### Auto Battle Feature

We have an implemented an "Auto Battle" feature wherein the user may create a list of attacks that they wish to execute. Each item of the list is comprised of a user monster selection, a monster attack selection, and an opponent selection. Once the user has finalized their choice of attacks, they must click the exit icon at the top right and click on "Auto Battle." Assuming that it is the user's turn, the board and the battle events log should then display the final result of the executed attacks.

#### A * Algorithm for Path Selection

An A* pathfinding logic is utilized by the "auto battle" feature. Based on the order of attacks specified by the user in the Auto Battle modal, the application will calculate the best available path to take to get to each opponent in the specified order. The final position of the user's monster upon completion of a series of "Auto Battle" attacks should be a tile adjacent to the final opponent selected. The pathfinding logic avoids any obstacles (e.g., other monsters, either the user's or an opponent's) that may be present on the board.

### Live Information

The live information section is shown on the right side of the application. This section includes two sub-sections: (1) Battle Chat; and (2) Battle Log.
#### Battle Chat

To the top right of the application is a battle chat window in which the user may view messages that they as well as other users in the same battle room have written. The messages are distinguished by different colors as well text alignment. The user's own messages are aligned to the right, in conformity with what is commonly seen in text message applications on mobile phones. The other users' messages will be aligned to the left. A time stamp is also included in the battle chat.

Chat messages are not stored anywhere in a central database and are simply epehemeral data objects sent via socket connection amongst any users connected to the same room.

#### Battle Log

The battle events log component of the app will display battle events that have transpired on the board, i.e., the results of various users' attacks. The text description of events are enclosed in colored bubbles, with different colored bubbles implying different results. A successful attack will be green in color, while an unsuccessful attack will be gray in color. If the user's attack is so successful that they are able to vanquish the enemy monster, the enemy's monster will not only fade from view on the board but also produce a red event bubble on the Battle Events log.
### Monster List

The monster list component consists of three sub-components: list, create, and details.

#### List

The list section will show which of the user's monsters are on the board and which of the user's monsters are off the board. There is also a color indicator next to the "On Board" heading showing which color belongs to the user. This color should be consistent with the border colors on the monster icons on the board as well as the turn indicator text shown at the very bottom of the screen.

#### Create

The create section will allows the user to create a new monster. The user may choose an avatar for the monster from a predetermined set of icons and add an arbitrarily large number of attacks. The user may also specify that multiples of the monster should be created.
#### Details

The details section is triggered when the user clicks on a specific monster's card in the list section of the application. Whereas the list section will only show the monster's name, health, armor, and movement, the details section shows those plus all other relevant details including: description, attacks, attack stats. There is also the option to delete a monster from the user's bestiary if the user so desires.

The fields on the detail page become editable if the user clicks on the edit button at the very bottom or if the user double clicks on any editable field. Then click on the submit button to confirm the changes.
